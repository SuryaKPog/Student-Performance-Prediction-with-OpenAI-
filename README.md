🎓 Student Performance Prediction 🚀

📌 Overview

This project aims to predict students' academic performance (CGPA for the next semester) based on multiple factors, including:

✅ Gender✅ Parental level of education✅ Lunch type✅ Test preparation status✅ Hours required per unit✅ Hours of sleep✅ Last semester's CGPA✅ Previous CGPA

The model leverages OpenAI's API for predictions and provides insights to help educators identify at-risk students for targeted interventions such as tutoring and counseling.
